      question: "Can I bring someone with me to the inspection?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You're welcome to bring family members, friends, or a rental advisor to the inspection. We recommend letting us know in advance if you plan to bring multiple people so we can ensure the agent has enough time to address everyone's questions."

      id: 6,
      question: "What happens after the inspection?",
      answer: "After the inspection, you'll have the opportunity to ask any remaining questions. If you're interested in the property, you can submit an application through our platform. Our team will review your application and typically respond within 24-48 hours. We'll guide you through the next steps if your application is approved."
